# WI4771TU: Final project

The aim of the final project is to practise the different concepts
taught in the course and to finally demonstrate the ability to apply
in the context of a slightly larger code.

Please choose one final project from this list (to be continued)

* [heat equation]


## Design criteria

As stated throughout the lecture, the is no single solution but
different ways to implement the final project. However, you should
review the different concepts taught in the course and apply them to
design a code that

*   is easy to read and to maintain
*   is efficient and well structures
*   does not contain unneccessary code duplication
*   makes use of features from the C++ standard library

## Submission

Final projects can be worked on either individually or (preferrably)
in groups of 2-3. Please submit your final project to
<wi4771tu.2017@gmail> indicating the student numbers and names of all
students of the group and with all source files attached to the
email. Submission deadline is 28/05/2017.

## Grading criteria

The final project will be graded in the same way as the homework
assignment, i.e.

*   0 points: not submitted, submitted but code does not compile, code
    has nothing to do with the assignment/all results wrong
*   1 point: code compiles and produces correct results but is
    implemented against all rules
*   2 points: code compiles, produces correct results and basically
    follows the aim of the assignment, but with quite frequent
    'inconsistencies' (e.g., consistent use of passing arguments by
    value even if passing arguments by constant reference is
    advisable). A single occurance of this is not considered 'frequent'.
*   3 points: premium code
